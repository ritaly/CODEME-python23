Be or not to be
Just do it
You do not find the happy life. You make it
Happiness is not by chance, but by choice
Keep your face to the sunshine
Impossible is for the unwilling
No pressure, no diamonds
Believe you can and youâ€™re halfway there
Have a dream, grab it, and never let go
Be the change you wish to see in the world
